If you’re a music superfan looking for a deeper connection with the music you love, now you can turn your playlist into a passive income stream."]},{"question":"What are music royalties?","answer":["For every piece of music, there are two copyrights: one for the composition and another for the recording of that composition. Music royalties are payments made to the creators and rights holders of music — the people who created or own the copyrights — for the authorized use of their work. These royalties and fees serve as compensation for the use of copyrighted music. They’re typically paid by entities such as streaming platforms, radio stations, television networks, film studios, and live performance venues.","Music royalties play a crucial role in supporting songwriters, artists, publishers, and labels by providing them with ongoing income for their creative works and resources to invest in creating new works. Investors can participate in the music business by acquiring music Royalty Shares, which entitle them to a portion of royalty income."]},{"question":"What kinds of income and royalties are generated by music?","answer":["There are several types of income interests generated by the use of copyrighted music. They include:"],"copyright":[{"term":"Composition:","types":[{"type":"1. Mechanical: These royalties are paid to songwriters, publishers, and administrators for the reproduction and distribution of their compositions. They are generated from physical and digital sales and streaming of the composition."},{"type":"2. Public Performance: These royalties are collected by performance rights organizations (PROs) and paid to songwriters, publishers, and administrators. They’re earned when a composition is performed publicly or broadcasted, including on radio, TV, live performances, and certain streaming platforms."},{"type":"3. Synchronization: These fees are earned when a composition is synchronized with visual media, such as movies, TV shows, commercials, and video games. The rights holders receive payment for the use of their music in these visual productions."},{"type":"4. Other: This could include income generated by print, karaoke, or social media, or other income generated by a composition that doesn't fit clearly into any of the above categories."},{"type":"5. Remix: Some Compositions include rights associated with related remixed versions of such Composition. The rights associated with remixes generally accrue royalties from the various income interest sources described above in the list."}]},{"term":"Sound Recording:","types":[{"type":"1. Sales: These royalties are generally paid to record labels from the sale of records in all formats (physical, downloads, and streams)."},{"type":"2. Synchronization: These fees are earned when a sound recording is synchronized with visual media, such as movies, TV shows, commercials, and video games. The rights holders receive payment for the use of their music in these visual productions."},{"type":"3. Neighboring Rights/Digital Performance: These are public performance royalties paid to the owner of the recording of the song performed and to the performers whose performance was recorded. They are generated by exploitations outside of the United States or when their recordings are played over digital and satellite radio in the US, such as Pandora, Sirius, and iHeartRadio when they collect similar “digital performance royalties.”"},{"type":"4. Other: This includes income generated by social media and or other income generated by a recording that doesn't fit clearly into any of the above categories."},{"type":"5. Royalty Participants: These royalties generated by the various exploitations of the sound recording are paid to producers, artists, engineers, and other key stakeholders. These royalties accrue from the various income interest sources described above in this list."},{"type":"6. Remix: Some Recordings include rights associated with related remixed versions of such Recording. The rights associated with remixes generally accrue royalties from the various income interest sources described above in this list."}]}]},{"question":"What are Royalty Shares?","answer":["Royalty Shares are the securitized music assets that will be offered by issuers on the JKBX platform. When purchasing Royalty Shares, you receive a contractual right to receive a specified portion of royalties, fees, and other income streams embodied in the Income Interests the issuer receives that relate to Royalty Rights for a specific Music Asset or a compilation of Music Assets.","For the sake of clarity, you do not receive any additional rights or licenses, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, voting rights, or commercial/personal usage rights."]}]},"resources":{"title":"Quick Resources","links":[{"label":"Music Glossary","path":"https://www.google.com"},{"label":"Pricing","path":"https://www.google.com"},{"label":"SEC / Legal","path":"https://www.google.com"},{"label":"Music Income Interest ROI","path":"https://www.google.com"}]}},"module_header":{"avatar_menu":[{"label":"Dashboard","path":"/account"},{"label":"Reservations","path":"/account/reservations"},{"label":"Transfer","path":"/account/transfer"},{"label":"Transactions","path":"/account/transactions"},{"label":"My Watchlist","path":"/account/watch-list"},{"label":"Settings","path":"/account/settings"},{"label":"Sign Out","path":"/api/auth/logout"}],"banner":{"signed_in":{"link":"Finish setting up your account","text":"Just a few more steps left before you can invest!","path":"/onboarding/profile/contact-info"},"signed_out":{"link":"Get Started","path":"/personal-info","text":"Get ready to invest!
